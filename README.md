# Nexedit

Nexedit is a powerful terminal-based text editor with a unique approach to file navigation and editing. It's designed to be efficient and intuitive, with a focus on keyboard-driven workflows.

## Key Features

- **File Finder**: Instead of fuzzy string matching, Nexedit's file finder uses string fragments to locate files. This approach tends to produce fewer but more accurate results.
- **Jump Mode**: Quickly navigate to on-screen elements using two-character jump tokens.
- **Symbol Jumping**: For files with syntax support, you can jump directly to class, method, and function definitions.
- **Vim-inspired Editing**: Familiar text editing and selection commands for those accustomed to Vim.
- **Built-in Clipboard Support**: No additional configuration required to interact with the system clipboard.
- **Git Integration**: View the current file's Git status and stage changes directly from Nexedit.

## Usage

To launch Nexedit, run the following command:



nexedit [dir | file1 file2 ...]
